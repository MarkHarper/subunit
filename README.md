Subunit

Library for D3 Selections in THREE.js

Currently in very early dev mode - these are not the droids you're looking for.

Still here?  Ok.  Check it out using bower...

```html
bower install subunit
```

To run the demos...do another bower install in the demos folder to load the dependencies.

```html
cd demos
bower install
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or your favorite local server)
```
